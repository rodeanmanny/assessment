<h2 style=color:orangered;font-family:script;">WHY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY? </h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">Everything you see, anything you do, seemed to involve information technology. And this could be enough reason why one could find interest in Information Technology. Personally, I have three reasons why I am interested in IT, fascination, knowledge and future-proofing.
<h3 style="color:blue;">1.Fascination</h3>  every time I see or use a product of technology, it awakens my curiosity and wondered how these things came about. It fascinates me how this magic of technology disrupts our normalcy.
<h3 style="color:blue;">2.Knowledge</h3> the fascination to understand how IT works motivates me to learn and gain knowledge. Studying Information Technology will provide me with the know-how and equip me  to better understand and discover more fascinating facets of IT.
<h3 style="color:blue;">3.Future-proofing</h3>  with knowledge gained learning Information Technology by earning a University degree opens door for new opportunities for me especially in terms of employment. Upskilling is an opportunity to be able to flow with the advancement in the future of job opportunities.</p>
<p>Enrolling to RMIT is not actually a choice. I enquired from the Open University about studying Information Technology and next thing I knew they have enrolled me to RMIT. I guess Open University staff knew their stuff and enrolled me into the university they think is best suited for the degree I want to earn.</p>
<p>I would expect to learn and gain better understanding of information technology. I would like to learn programming, security and analytics. I would like to be able to be equip with the knowledge to be able create apps, make programs and/or enhance security.

<h2 style=color:darkmagenta;font-family:script;"> WHAT AM I MADE OF?</h2>
<p> <div style="border:2px solid Red;background-color:beige;color:darkblue"><h3>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test Results</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">ESTJ is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). ESTJs are often described as practical, take-charge kind of people. David Keirsey, the creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, suggests that approximately eight to twelve percent of all people have an ESTJ personality.
ESTJ Characteristics
<p style="text-align:left;">The MBTI looks at personality preferences in four key areas: 1) Extraversion vs Introversion, 2) Sensing vs Intuition, 3) Thinking vs Feeling and 4) Judging vs Perceiving. As youve probably already guessed, the acronym ESTJ represents Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking and Judging.
	
<ul><b>Etraversion</b>: ESTJs are outgoing and enjoy leading and supervising other people.</ul>

<ul><b>Sensing</b>: ESTJs enjoy concrete facts as opposed to abstract information.</ul>

<ul><b>Thinking</b>: ESTJs rely on objective information and logic to make decision rather than personal feelings.</ul>
<ul><b>Judging</b>: ESTJs like control and order, so they like to plan things well in advance.</ul></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Some common ESTJ characteristics include:
<ul>Practical and realistic</ul>
<ul>Dependable</ul>
<ul>Self-confidence</ul>
<ul>Hard-working</ul>
<ul>Traditional</ul>
<ul>Enjoys leading</ul>
<ul>Very structured and organized</ul>
<ul>Sticks to their standards</ul>
<ul>Strongly dislikes inefficiency and disorganization</ul>
<ul>Seeks out like-minded individuals</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">People with ESTJ personality types tend to be very practical. They enjoy learning about things that they can see an immediate, real-world use for, but tend to lose interest in things that are abstract or theoretical. ESTJs are also focused on the here and now and donâ€™t spend a great deal of time worrying about events in the past or what might happen in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Individuals with this personality type tend to place a high value on tradition, rules and security. 
<p style="text-align:left;">Maintaining the status quo is important to ESTJs and they often become involved in civics, government and community organizations. Because they appreciate order and organization, they frequently do well in supervisory roles. When in such positions, they are committed to making sure that members of the group follow rules and traditions and law established by higher authorities.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Because of their orthodox approach to life, they can sometimes be seen as rigid, stubborn and unyielding. Their take-charge attitude makes it easy for ESTJs to assume leadership positions. Their self-confidence and strong convictions help them excel at putting plans into action, but they can at times appear critical and overly aggressive, particular when other people fail to live up to their high standards.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In school and work situations, ESTJs are very hard-working and dependable. They strive to follow directions to the letter and show a great deal of respect and deference for authority figures. They are thorough and punctual about completing their work and rarely question or complain about the work.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">As extraverts, ESTJs are very outgoing and enjoy spending time in the company of others. They can be very boisterous and funny in social situations and often enjoy being at the center of attention. Family is also of the upmost importance to ESTJs. They put a great deal of effort into fulfilling their family obligations. Social events are also important and they are good at remembering important events such as birthdays and anniversaries. They look forward to attending weddings, family reunions, holiday parties, class reunions and other occasions.</p>

<p>Your Scores:
<ul>Auditory: 35%</ul>
<ul>Visual: 55%</ul>
<ul>Tactile: 10%</ul></p>
You are a Visual learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.
Visual
<p>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
<p>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>
<p>Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
<ul>Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)</ul>
<ul>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</ul>
<ul>Use flashcards to learn new words.</ul>
<ul>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.</ul>
<ul>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.</ul>
<ul>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.</ul>
<ul>Color code things.</ul>
<ul>Avoid distractions during study times.</ul>
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><i>These results just prove what I have known for a long time. There is nothing surprising about these results. I do not think it will influence much on my behavior in a team as it mirrors how I behave currently in a team environment. I would probably make some adjustments in the early days as I start to know my team.</i></p>
<br>
<h2 style=color:darkgoldenrod;font-family:script;">WHAT IS COOKING IN MY IT'ESQUE MIND? </h2>
<p style="text-align:left;">My idea is a simple notification application. As they say, simple ideas make greater impact. The purpose of this notification app is to alert a person for an incoming bill or direct debit so that he can check out his account if he has enough funds to make the payment when it is due.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In this very busy and fast paced life, IT has provided us technologies which resolves some of our day to day pain points. And one of these innovations is being able to create direct debit on our banking platforms which save us from going to the bank branches or AustPost branches to make payments for our bills. So, we set up our direct debits and forget about it as it automatically do the payments for us. And this is where the pain sometimes usually starts.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">As a banker for 19 years I am pretty much aware of the consequences of not being able to pay your bills. Not only that you have to pay a dishonor fee for failure to make a payment due to insufficient funds available to your account when the payment is due, this also attract a default on your payment. And defaults on payment does affect your credit score. And if your credit score is undesirable, that affects your ability to apply for a loan, credit card or even a phone application. This will result in application rejection over and over until you have improved your credit score.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">And this is where my idea will come in. I will call this notification application <b>NaugthyPayMe</b>  yeah! It sounds like Notify me). The idea of this application is when you set up a direct debit, you can input the details of this direct debit on the application. The details required will include the frequency of the payment, the amount and what the payment is for. Then you can set up the no of the days before the due of the payment when you want the application to notify you. For example, you want to be notified 7 days before the payment is due. Let say you have monthly direct debit which fall every 16th of the month, so the app will notify you on the 9th of each month that there is a payment due in 7 days. It will advise you of the amount and the bill you are paying. This will give you ample time to check your banking account if you have sufficient amount on your account to make this payment. You can also snooze the notification so that another notification will be send to you on the day of your choosing.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">If this idea will come to fruition, a user will be able to set up notification to alert hi.her of an impending payment. The user will be able to check his account for availability of funds on his account so he can be able to make a sound decision. This will allow user to make payments on time and avert impending dishonor fees and also a default on the user payment and effect on credit score.</p>
